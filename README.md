This repository contains implementations of influential research papers in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Each implementation aims to be:
- 🧩 **Self-contained** with minimal dependencies
- 📖 **Well-documented** with paper references
- ✅ **Reproducible** with training/evaluation scripts
